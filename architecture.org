* General Description

- 4 bit nibbles as processor word size
- 1 bit databus
- stack machine
  - stack is cleared on cycle start
  - code executes until a cycle start happens or the end of code memory is
    reached, in which case a new cycle is started
- When in reset, you can shift data into the code memory
- 8 input bits/registers mapped to pins
- 1 io bits/registers not mapped to a pin
- 8 io bits/registers mapped to pins
- 7 output bits/registers mapped to pins
- 1 error bit mapped to a pin
- X bit data stack (let's see how big it can be made?)
- X nibble code memory
- 1 16-bit timer/counter with clock divisor
- 1 main clock divisor (to take the system/instruction clock to a cycle clock)
